# JavaScript Exercises
This repository contains exercises to practice JavaScript code.
## Beginner Exercises
**Variables and Data Types**
1. Declare a variable named `myName` and assign your name to it. Then, log it to the console.
2. Create a variable `age` and assign your age to it. Log a message to the console that says "I am [age] years old".
3. Create a variable `isStudent` and assign it a boolean value indicating whether you are a student or not. Log the value to the console.
**Functions**
1. Create a function named `greet` that takes a name as a parameter and logs a greeting message to the console.
2. Call the `greet` function with your name as an argument.
3. Create a function named `add` that takes two numbers as parameters and returns their sum. Call the function and log the result to the console.
**Conditions and Loops**
1. Write a function named `isEven` that takes a number as a parameter and returns `true` if the number is even, and `false` if it is odd. Test the function with different numbers.
2. Create a loop that counts from 1 to 10 and logs each number to the console.
3. Create a loop that iterates over an array of your favorite fruits and logs each fruit to the console.
**Arrays and Objects**  
1. Create an array named `colors` that contains your favorite colors. Log the array to the console.
2. Add a new color to the `colors` array and log the updated array to the console.
3. Create an object named `person` with properties `name`, `age`, and `isStudent`. Log the object to the console.
## Intermediate Exercises
**DOM Manipulation**
1. Create a simple HTML page with a button and a div element. Write JavaScript code to change the text of the div when the button is clicked.
2. Create a list of items in an array and display them as an unordered list in the HTML page.
3. Add an input field and a button to the HTML page. Write JavaScript code to add the value from the input field to the list when the button is clicked.
**Event Handling**
1. Add an event listener to the button that calls a function to add the input value to the list.
2. Create a function that removes an item from the list when it is clicked. The function should take the item as a parameter and remove it from the DOM.
3. Add a hover effect to the list items that changes their background color when the mouse is over them.
**Classes and Objects**
1. Create a class named `Car` with properties `make`, `model`, and `year`. Add a method named `getInfo` that returns a string with the car's information.
2. Create an instance of the `Car` class and log the car's information to the console.
3. Create a class named `Person` with properties `name` and `age`. Add a method named `greet` that logs a greeting message to the console. Create an instance of the `Person` class and call the `greet` method.
## Advanced Exercises
**Asynchronous JavaScript**
1. Write a function that fetches data from a public API (e.g., JSONPlaceholder) and logs the data to the console using `fetch` and `async/await`.
2. Create a function that simulates a delay using `setTimeout` and returns a promise. Use `async/await` to call the function and log a message after the delay.
3. Create a function that fetches data from two different APIs and combines the results. Use `Promise.all` to handle the multiple promises.
**Error Handling**
1. Write a function that fetches data from a public API (e.g., JSONPlaceholder) and logs any errors to the console.
2. Create a function that uses `try/catch` to handle errors when fetching data from an API.
3. Add error handling to the function that combines data from two APIs, logging any errors that occur.
**Advanced DOM Manipulation**
1. Create a simple to-do list application that allows users to add, remove, and mark tasks as completed. Use local storage to save the tasks.
2. Create a modal popup that appears when a button is clicked. The modal should contain a form with input fields and a submit button. When the form is submitted, log the input values to the console and close the modal.
3. Create a responsive navigation menu that toggles between a hamburger menu and a full menu based on the screen size. Use CSS and JavaScript to achieve this.
