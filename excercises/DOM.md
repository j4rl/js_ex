# DOM Manipulation Exercises
This file contains exercises to practice DOM manipulation in JavaScript.
## Beginner Exercises
1. Create a simple HTML page with a button and a div element. Write JavaScript code to change the text of the div when the button is clicked.
2. Create a list of items in an array and display them as an unordered list in the HTML page.
3. Add an input field and a button to the HTML page. Write JavaScript code to add the value from the input field to the list when the button is clicked.
## Intermediate Exercises
1. Add an event listener to the button that calls a function to add the input value to the list.
2. Create a function that removes an item from the list when it is clicked. The function should take the item as a parameter and remove it from the DOM.
3. Add a hover effect to the list items that changes their background color when the mouse is over them.
## Advanced Exercises
1. Create a simple to-do list application that allows users to add, remove, and mark tasks as completed. Use local storage to save the tasks.
2. Create a modal popup that appears when a button is clicked. The modal should contain a form with input fields and a submit button. When the form is submitted, log the input values to the console and close the modal.
3. Create a responsive navigation menu that toggles between a hamburger menu and a full menu based on the screen size. Use CSS and JavaScript to achieve this.
**Note:** These exercises are designed to help you practice and improve your JavaScript and DOM manipulation skills. Feel free to modify the exercises or add more challenges as you progress.  
# DOM Manipulation and Event Handling Exercises
## Game Projects
1. Create a simple game where the player has to guess a randomly generated number between 1 and 100. Provide feedback if the guess is too high or too low. Allow the player to restart the game after guessing correctly.
2. Create a game where the player can choose rock, paper, or scissors. The computer randomly selects one of the three options. Determine the winner based on the rules of the game and display the result.
3. Create a 3x3 grid where two players can take turns placing their marks (X and O). Check for a win or a draw after each move and display the result. Allow players to restart the game after it ends.
4. Create a grid of cards that are face down. When a player clicks on a card, it flips over to reveal an image. The player can flip two cards at a time. If they match, they stay face up; if not, they flip back down. The game ends when all pairs are found.
5. Make a spacehip game where the player controls a spaceship that moves around the screen, shooting asteroids. The game ends if the spaceship collides with an asteroid. Display the player's score based on how many asteroids have been destroyed.
6. Create a grid with holes where moles randomly pop up. The player has to click on the moles to score points. Set a time limit for the game and display the final score at the end.
## Productivity Tools
1. Create a simple to-do list application that allows users to add, remove, and mark tasks as completed. Use local storage to save the tasks.
2. Create a modal popup that appears when a button is clicked. The modal should contain a form with input fields and a submit button. When the form is submitted, log the input values to the console and close the modal.
3. Create a responsive navigation menu that toggles between a hamburger menu and a full menu based on the screen size. Use CSS and JavaScript to achieve this.
## Project excercises to solve common web problems
1. Create a form validation script that checks if the input fields are filled out correctly before submitting the form. Display error messages for invalid fields.
2. Create a dynamic image gallery that allows users to filter images based on categories. Use buttons or dropdowns to select categories and display only the relevant images.
3. Create a lightbox effect for images in a gallery. When an image is clicked, display it in a larger view with a dark overlay. Include navigation buttons to move to the next or previous image.
4. Create a sticky navigation bar that remains at the top of the page when the user scrolls down. Use JavaScript to add or remove a CSS class based on the scroll position. 
5. Create a "back to top" button that appears when the user scrolls down the page. When clicked, the button should smoothly scroll the user back to the top of the page.
6. Create a countdown timer that counts down to a specific date and time. Display the remaining days, hours, minutes, and seconds on the page.
**Note:** These projects will help you practice various JavaScript concepts such as event handling, DOM manipulation, game logic, and more. Feel free to expand on these ideas and add your own features to make the games or tools more interesting!
