# Small game projects
Here are some small game projects to practice JavaScript:
1. **Guess the Number**
   - Create a simple game where the player has to guess a randomly generated number between 1 and 100.
   - Provide feedback if the guess is too high or too low.
   - Allow the player to restart the game after guessing correctly.
2. **Rock, Paper, Scissors**
    - Create a game where the player can choose rock, paper, or scissors.
    - The computer randomly selects one of the three options.
    - Determine the winner based on the rules of the game and display the result.
3. **Tic Tac Toe**
    - Create a 3x3 grid where two players can take turns placing their marks (X and O).
    - Check for a win or a draw after each move and display the result. 
    - Allow players to restart the game after it ends.
4. **Memory Game**
    - Create a grid of cards that are face down.
    - When a player clicks on a card, it flips over to reveal an image.
    - The player can flip two cards at a time. If they match, they stay face up; if not, they flip back down.
    - The game ends when all pairs are found.
5. **Snake Game**
    - Create a simple version of the classic Snake game.
    - The player controls a snake that moves around the screen, eating food to grow longer.
    - The game ends if the snake runs into itself or the walls. 
    - Display the player's score based on how many pieces of food the snake has eaten.
6. **Whack-a-Mole**
    - Create a grid with holes where moles randomly pop up.
    - The player has to click on the moles to score points.
    - Set a time limit for the game and display the final score at the end.
7. **Platformer Game**
    - Create a simple platformer game where the player can move left, right, and jump.
    - Add obstacles and platforms for the player to navigate.   
    - Include a goal or endpoint for the player to reach to win the game.
8. **Flappy Bird Clone**
    - Create a game where the player controls a bird that must fly through gaps in pipes.
    - The player earns points for each set of pipes they successfully navigate through.
    - The game ends if the bird hits a pipe or the ground.
    - Display the player's score at the end of the game.

These projects will help you practice various JavaScript concepts such as event handling, DOM manipulation, game logic, and more. Feel free to expand on these ideas and add your own features to make the games more interesting!
