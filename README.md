## About JavaScript
**JavaScript** is not **Java**
- JavaScript is a scripting language
- the file `_variable.js_` is an example of variables in javascript.
- the file `_function.js_` is an example of functions in javascript. (both normal and arrow functions)
- `_conditions_loops.js_` is an example of conditions and loops in javascript.
- the file `_class.js_` is an example of classes in javascript.
- `_index.html_`, `_style.css_` and `_script.js_` are examples of how to use javascript in html. 
  with the help of the DOM(Document Object Model) we can manipulate the html elements.
  ...also it gives an example of how to use event listeners in javascript.

## Differences between JavaScript and Python
- JavaScript is a scripting language, Python is a programming language.
- JavaScript uses {} to define blocks of code, Python uses indentation.
- JavaScript uses var, let and const to define variables, Python uses just a variable name.
- JavaScript uses function to define functions, Python uses def.

## Similarities between JavaScript and Python
- Both are dynamically typed.
- Both are object-oriented.
- Both are interpreted.
- Both are case-sensitive.
- Both are cross-platform.
- Both are open-source.
- Both are high-level languages.

## Why use vanilla JavaScript?
- It is faster than using a library or framework.
- It reduces the size of your web application.
- It improves the performance of your web application.
- It gives you more control over your code.
- It helps you learn the fundamentals of JavaScript.
