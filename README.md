- [DOM explained](docs/DOM_examples.md)
***
**JavaScript** examples, plain JavaScript files with code to copy, or just read and learn from.
- [Variables](js/variables.js) The file `_variable.js_` is an example of variables in javascript.
- [Functions](js/functions.js) The file `_function.js_` is an example of functions in javascript.
- [Conditions and Loops](js/conditions_loops.js) The file `_conditions_loops.js_` is an example of conditions and loops in javascript.
- [Classes](js/class.js) The file `_class.js_` is an example of classes in javascript.
- [DOM manipulation](ex/DOM/index.html) (also includes style.css and script.js)
   - `_index.html_`, `_style.css_` and `_script.js_` are examples of how to use javascript in html. 
  with the help of the DOM(Document Object Model) we can manipulate the html elements.
  ...also it gives an example of how to use event listeners in javascript.

## About JavaScript
**JavaScript** is not **Java**
- JavaScript is a scripting language
- Java is a programming language
- JavaScript is used to make web pages interactive
- Never confuse JavaScript with Java, they are two different languages.
- JavaScript was created in 10 days by Brendan Eich in 1995.
- The name JavaScript was chosen for marketing reasons, to ride on the popularity of Java at the time.
- JavaScript is a client-side language, which means that it runs in the user's web browser, not on the server as PHP does.
- JavaScript is an interpreted language, which means that it does not need to be compiled before it can be run.
- JavaScript is a dynamically typed language, which means that you do not need to specify the data type of a variable when you declare it.
- JavaScript is an object-oriented language, which means that it supports the use of objects and classes.
- Typescript is a superset of JavaScript that adds static types and other features to the language.
- JavaScript is standardized by the ECMAScript specification, which is maintained by ECMA International.

## Differences between JavaScript and Python
- JavaScript is a scripting language, Python is a programming language.
- JavaScript uses {} to define blocks of code, Python uses indentation.
- JavaScript uses var, let and const to define variables, Python uses just a variable name.
- JavaScript uses function to define functions, Python uses def.

## Similarities between JavaScript and Python
- Both are dynamically typed.
- Both are object-oriented.
- Both are interpreted.
- Both are case-sensitive.
- Both are cross-platform.
- Both are open-source.
- Both are high-level languages.

## Why use vanilla JavaScript?
- It is faster than using a library or framework.
- It reduces the size of your web application.
- It improves the performance of your web application.
- It gives you more control over your code.
- It helps you learn the fundamentals of JavaScript.
